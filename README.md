# MicroKeyboard

MicroKeyboard is a small customizable keyboard/mouse.


Based on [ArduinoMicro](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro), it allows you to choose the function to be associated with each single key, including encoder and thumbstick.



MicroKeyboard is open-source and open-hardware but you can still decide to buy one already assembled on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/chris_maker_/microkeyboard/)
